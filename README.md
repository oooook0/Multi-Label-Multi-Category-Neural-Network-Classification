# Multi-Label-Multi-Category-Neural-Network-Classification

#### 1 - An example of Multi-Label Multi-Category Classification

the exmaple uses 2 hidden layers Neural Network/n
each neural network uses rectifer unit as activation function

You can play around the change the class if you want, this class is reusable
